# Python API Project - What's the Weather Like?


A Python script is created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I employed [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)


## Observation

- Southern Hemisphere climates tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. This is because the Southern Hemisphere has significantly more ocean and much less land; water heats up and cools down more slowly than land.\n 

- Highest temperature is found at 0 latitude and as the latidude increases or decreases, temperature drops. This happens as equatorial region receives sunlight straight with less or no angle due to curvature shape of earth.\n

- Latitude doesn't have a strong iinfluence on wind speed. The speed of the wind is controlled by the strength of the air pressure gradient, the stronger the pressure gradient the higher the wind speed.\n

- Most of the cities tend to have a humidity above 60%, while the humidity of those cities with latitude between 0 to 40 tends to vary more. Cities with latitude between 40 to 80 often have a humidity between 80% to 100%.\n

- The cities with latitude 40 to 80 tends to have a cloudiness clustering at 80% to 100%. However, the rest of the data points seem to distributed evenly on the plot. Hence, there isn't much of a correlation between coludiness and latitude.\n
